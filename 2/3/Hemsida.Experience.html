<h1>My Experience</h1>
<div class="center">
<p>
        I was one of the most active members in the juggling club. I held many presentations, and contributed to the club in a lot of ways. My main task was buying food and teaching Allan the ways of a juggler.        
        
        As of now I have no prior working experience. However I am currently striving to change that. </p>
